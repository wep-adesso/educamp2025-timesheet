This project is a React single page application (SPA) for tracking time spent on multiple items. Users can create items with descriptions, start/stop timers independently, view real-time elapsed time, and see a summary of total time spent per item at the end of the workday. Data should persist in local storage. The UI should be clear and user-friendly.
